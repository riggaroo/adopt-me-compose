Based off a design on Uplabs, I tried to replicate as much of it as possible, whilst still adding my own interpretation.
The data is hardcoded but could easily be moved to using a service call.

This is the design I based it on: [Design](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/pet-adoption-app-play-the-prototype-on-uigiants-com)
I added a small lottie animation from [here](https://lottiefiles.com/18265-my-french-bulldog).
